# C Programming by K. N. King

This repo is for the progamming exercises I did while reading along with *C Programming* by *K. N. King*. 

Each directory is a chapter, with files named for the exercise I completed! I usually only do one exercise a chapter to keep moving, but I have found this book to be really good!
